# MERKURI

url to the live website will soon be uploaded.

## Introduction
This project is to help optimize project management on a small scale with a budget analaysis provided. MERKURI is a play on Mercury which is the Roman God of wealth and prosperity. An admin would be allowed to add members to his project with either a phone number or email, and assign tasks based on a schedule, description, and budget.

## Description
First the user must make an account with MERKURI giving a name, username, email, and password. The number is used for the chat channel within each project. After that, he would be considered the admin, and would add the other members joining his team for that particular project. The Admin assigns the task then the team member will strike out the task after completion, and enter the expenses that were required. This would show a visual of the budget with a line showing the budget threshold.
